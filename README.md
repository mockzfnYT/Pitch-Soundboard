## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mockzfnyt/Pitch-Soundboard/issues) on GitHub.

For clean tone generation:
- Close other audio applications
- Use quality headphones or speakers
- Refresh page if you experience beating or interference
- Ensure proper system audio settings

---

**Note:** This generator produces mathematically precise frequencies. If you hear beating or pulsing, it typically indicates interference from other audio sources rather than generator inaccuracy.
